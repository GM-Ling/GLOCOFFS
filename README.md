## How are the Forecasts Obtained?

Forecasts are 2D barotropic ocean circulation and inundation simulations on unstructured triangular meshes subject to meteorological and astronomical forcings which drive surge and tide respectively. 

The meshes have been automatically generated using the [OceanMesh2D](https://github.com/CHLNDDEV/OceanMesh2D) Matlab meshing toolbox. A single seamless unstructured mesh is used for each forecast. The default mesh which covers the entire Earth has a variable coastal resolution ranging between 2 km and 10 km depending on shoreline complexity. Moreover, when a storm is predicted to make landfall a higher resolution (~90 m) inset around the forecasted landfalling region is automatically merged into the global mesh to provide accurate forecasts of extreme water levels and flooding in the landfall region. In this way we can minimize the computational resources in order to provide timely forecasts without sacrificing accuracy where coastal flooding occurs.

Nearly 2000 high-resolution (~90 m) 1 deg x 1 deg inset meshes (indicated by the red boxes in the image below) have been automatically generated with [OceanMesh2D](https://github.com/CHLNDDEV/OceanMesh2D). These insets are merged into the global mesh as necessary.

### Inputs and Sources
- Meteorology: [FV3-GFS](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/users/Alicia.Bentley/fv3gfs/) model 10-m wind velocities (U10 and V10) and atmospheric pressure reduced to mean sea level (PRMSL). [Link for latest 2-day - archive of forecasts](https://para.nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/gfs/para/)
- Topography/Bathymetry: Default for the Earth: [SRTM15+V2.0](https://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm15_plus.html) (~450 m); for high-resolution insets topography is replaced with [SRTM3](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SRTM3/) (~90 m) data.
- Shoreline Geometry: Default for the Earth: [GSSHG](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhg/); for high-resolution insets shoreline is replaced with the [SWBD](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/SWBD/) (~30-90 m accuracy) SRTM-based dataset.
